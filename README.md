Personal Portfolio Website Documentation
Overview

This documentation outlines the development and deployment process of my personal portfolio website. The project showcases my skills, projects, certificates, and professional information, serving as a digital resume for potential employers and industry professionals.
Hosting

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, a free and straightforward service that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. The deployment process was seamless and efficient, enabling quick updates and version control through Git.

Process:

    Created a GitHub repository for the project.
    Pushed the project files to the repository.
    Enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings, selecting the main branch as the source.
    The website is now live at: [Your GitHub Pages URL]

Innovation

Creating a unique and personalized design was a primary goal for this project. Instead of following a tutorial step-by-step, I conceptualized and implemented a design that reflects my preferences and professional identity. Key innovative aspects include:

    Custom layout and structure tailored to my needs.
    Personalized animations and interactivity.
    Integration of Formspree for seamless contact form functionality without the need for backend development.

    Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling, allowing rapid and consistent design.
    Bootstrap: For responsive grid layout and reusable components.
    Formspree: For handling contact form submissions.

Compatibility

Ensuring cross-browser and cross-device compatibility was a significant focus. The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations.

Compatibility Features:

    Responsive design using Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap.
    Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent appearance and functionality.
    Mobile-first approach to ensure a smooth experience on smartphones and tablets.

Navigation

The website features a user-friendly navigation system, making it easy for visitors to find information.

Navigation Elements:
